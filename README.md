## Summary of this repository

Dataset | Description | Projects
--- | ---| ---|
[Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) | The original MNIST image dataset of handwritten digits is a popular benchmark for image-based machine learning methods but researchers have renewed efforts to update it and develop drop-in replacements that are more challenging for computer vision and original for real-world applications. You might already be familiar with the [Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist) dataset. It is an MNIST-like dataset of 70,000 28x28 labeled fashion images.|
