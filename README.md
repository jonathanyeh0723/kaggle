## Summary of this repository

[Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) | The original MNIST image dataset of handwritten digits is a popular benchmark for image-based machine learning methods but researchers have renewed efforts to update it and develop drop-in replacements that are more challenging for computer vision and original for real-world applications. You might already be familiar with the [Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist) dataset. It is an MNIST-like dataset of 70,000 28x28 labeled fashion images. To stimulate the community to develop more drop-in replacements, the Sign Language MNIST is presented here and follows the same CSV format with labels and pixel values in single rows. The American Sign Language letter database of hand gestures represent a multi-class problem with 24 classes of letters (excluding J and Z which require motion).
